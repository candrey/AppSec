An attacker can manipulate the URL and redirect users to an arbitrary domain. Open redirect vulnerabilities can lead to issues such as Cross-site scripting (XSS) or redirecting to a malicious domain for activities such as phishing to capture users' credentials. To prevent this vulnerability perform strict input validation of the domain against an allowlist of approved domains. Notify a user in your application that they are leaving the website. Display a domain where they are redirected to the user. A user can then either accept or deny the redirect to an untrusted site.
